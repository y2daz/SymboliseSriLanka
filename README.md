# SymboliseSriLanka
A set of SVG and QML styles for GIS software, suitable for Sri Lanka.

## SVG

Some created SVG files were intended for point data while others, for polygons with the intention of tiling.

## PNG

PNG files of the vectors have been provided both for visualisation and if raster is preferred for symbolisation.

## Styles

The styles provided work for QGIS. Line data symbols were created using the software, so all symbology is included in the QML file.

## Data

Data source for each stylesheet is mentioned in the name (OSM, Survey Department of Sri Lanka) with the exception of vegetation data, for which data was created from the OSM data for rule creation.

## Using the files

1. Add the SVG folder into QGIS SVG folder list.
2. Add the relevant QML style to a vector layer.

You may have to change the rules slightly for it work perfectly.
